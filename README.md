## Pre-requisites
In order to complete this lab, you will need the following:
1) A [Pivotal Web Services](https://run.pivotal.io) account
1) [Spring Tool Suite](https://spring.io/tools) or your preferred Java/Spring IDE
1) Lastes version of [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
1) Latest version of [Git client](https://git-scm.com/)
1) Latest version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
1) Latest version of [Concourse's fly command-line tool](https://github.com/concourse/fly)

## Contract Testing
Dev teams frequently need to make schema changes and/or functionality changes to existing services.
The main challenge is: __How do you do that without impacting your existing consumers?__ Pivotal's recommendation is to leverage Consumer-driven contracts. That way, based on a common API contract, you can run integration tests between the consumer and a mock provider; and, between the real provider and a mock consumer; __alll of this without setting up all your upstream or downstream systems__. 
The main goal is to fail the build of the application when there is faulty integration, so together with unit and integration tests, your contract tests must have a place in your test suite.

## Who should use consumer-drive contracts?
This pattern is applicable in the context of either a single enterprise or a closed community of well-know services where providers have some influence over how consumers establish contracts with them.

## Contract Testing with Spring Cloud Contract
With Spring Cloud Contract, you can successfully implement Consumer-driven Contracts for both JVM-based apps and [non-JVM apps](https://spring.io/blog/2018/02/13/spring-cloud-contract-in-a-polyglot-world). You can use it for both HTTP-based and message-based interactions. Spring Cloud Contract __greatly simplifies and significantly automates the maintenance of consumer-driven contracts for both producers and consumers__. Let's see how it does it.

In this lab, we’ll explore writing producer- and consumer-side test cases through an HTTP interaction. To understand Spring Cloud Contract concepts, let's use it in the context of two (2) Spring Boots apps:

1) The `PersonService` app (a.k.a. the producer) which provides an API to find a given person using his or her ID
1) The `MyAccount` app (a.k.a. the consumer) which accesses that API to get said person's names, email and phone. 

![The System](TheSystem.png)



## Getting started
1) Create a folder in the filesystem and `cd` to it
1) `git clone https://github.com/Pivotal-Field-Engineering/s1p-2018-contract-testing.git`
1) Import it as an _Existing Maven project_ into your IDE. Choose the `s1p-2018-contract-testing` folder as the `Root Directory`

## Build the `PersonService` app
During the current Sprint, the `PersonService` team has created the contract test's parent class: [BaseClass](person-service/src/test/java/hello/BaseClass.java).

In parallel, the `MyAccount` team created the consumer-driver contract [find_person_by_id.groovy](person-service/src/test/resources/contracts/hello/find_person_by_id.groovy); and provided it to the `PersonService` team, which included the contract definition in the `PersonService` codebase.

![contract.png](contract.png)

Feel free to review both BaseClass and the consumer contract using your IDE.

We are ready to build the app via these commands:
```
cd <YOUR_FOLDER>/s1p-2018-contract-testing/person-service
mvn clean package
```
This picture depicts what happens when you build the app:
![build-person-service](build-person-service.png)

1) When the [Maven build](person-service/pom.xml) runs, Spring Cloud Contract Verifier use the contract definition to _automatically generate_ full tests on your behalf
1) You can use your IDE to view the source code of the generated test at: `/person-service/target/generated-test-sources/contracts/hello/HelloTest.java`
1) Once Spring Cloud Contract verifies that `PersonService` implementation is compliant with the contract, Maven generates and installs both stub artifact (`person-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-stubs.jar`) and the `PersonService` app artifact (`person-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`) in your designated Maven repo.

## Build the `MyAccount` app
During the same Sprint, the `MyAccount` app has also created a [consumer-driven contract test](/myaccount-client/src/test/java/hello/MyAccountApplicationTest.java) to ensure the integration with the `PersonService` app is aligned with the specifications.

Let's build the app:
```
cd <YOUR_FOLDER>/s1p-2018-contract-testing/myaccount-client
mvn clean package
```
This picture depicts what happens when you build the app:

![build-myaccount-client](build-myaccount-client.png)

1) When the [Maven build](/myaccount-client/pom.xml) is executed, the Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner in your JUnit test will __automatically download the required stubs from your designated Maven repo__
1) The Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner will also __automatically start a WireMock server inside your test and feed it with the stubs it downloaded in the previous step__
1) Once Spring Cloud Contract verifies that `MyAccount` implementation is compliant with the contract, Maven generates and installs the `MyAccount` artifact (`myaccount-client-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`) in your designated Maven repo

## Service evolution: Change `PersonService` endpoint from `/person` to `/people`
1) Open your IDE
1) Find the `findPersonById` method in the [PersonRestController](/person-service/src/main/java/hello/PersonRestController.java) 
1) Change its annotation from `@GetMapping("/person/{id}")` to `@GetMapping("/people/{id}")`. Save your changes.
1) Build the `PersonService` app
1) Was the build successful or it failed? Why?
1) Change its annotation back to `@GetMapping("/person/{id}")`. Save your changes
1) Build the `PersonService` app

## Service evolution: Change `Person` schema attribute from `surname` to `lastname`
1) Open your IDE
1) Find the [Person class](/person-service/src/main/java/hello/Person.java) 
1) Use your IDE to replace the `surname` string with `lastname`. Save your changes
1) Build the `PersonService` app
1) Was the build successful or it failed? Why?
1) Use your IDE to replace the `lastname` string with `surname`. Save your changes
1) Build the `PersonService` app


## Continuous Delivery to production with Concourse 
Now that we are happy with our local test, we need to deploy both `PersonService` and `MyAccount` apps to production on Pivotal Web Services. Let's get started.

### Start Concourse

In a new Terminal window, check if Concourse is already running
```
docker ps
```
If Concourse is running, you will see results similar to these:
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                 COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
71d8a710ebb1        concourse/concourse   "/usr/local/bin/dumb…"   23 hours ago        Up 23 hours         0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   s1p-2018-contract-testing_concourse_1
21cb03f9e3a7        postgres              "docker-entrypoint.s…"   23 hours ago        Up 23 hours         5432/tcp                 s1p-2018-contract-testing_concourse-db_1
```
If Concourse is not running, issue this command
```
cd <YOUR_FOLDER>/s1p-2018-contract-testing
docker-compose start
```

### Customize the CI/CD pipeline with your preferences

Now login to Concourse via the `fly` command-line: 
```
fly login -t s1p -u test -p test -c http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Customize the Concourse [parameters](ci/params.yml) file with your Pivotal Web Services settings. For example:
```
USERNAME: abc@gmail.com
PASSWORD: n01d3@
ORG: S1Pdemo1
SPACE: development
PERSON-SERVICE-APP-NAME: gt-person-service
MYACCOUNT-CLIENT-APP-NAME: gt-myaccount-client
```
Set the pipeline and unpause it
```
cd <YOUR_FOLDER>/s1p-2018-contract-testing/ci
fly -t s1p set-pipeline -p deploy-s1p-2018 -c pipeline.yml -l params.yml
fly -t s1p unpause-pipeline --pipeline deploy-s1p-2018
```
In your browser, go to [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080/) with test/test as username and password.
Select the `deploy-s1p-2018` pipeline.

### Run the CI/CD pipeline: Happy path

To trigger the Concourse deployment pipeline, choose the `deploy-person-service` box and the hit the `+` sign on the right hand corner.

![concourse_job](concourse_job.png)

Wait a few minutes until the pipeline finishes deploying both apps to PWS. After the Concourse pipeline successfully completes, you should now see the entire pipeline as shown below:

![concourse_details](concourse_details.png)


To access the `PersonService`, access this URL: `https://PERSON-SERVICE-APP-NAME.cfapps.io/person/1`. You should get this result:
```
{"id":1,"name":"Person","surname":"One"}
```

To access the `MyAccount` app, access this URL: `https://MYACCOUNT-CLIENT-APP-NAME.cfapps.io/message/1`. You should get this result:
```
Hello Person One
```

### Run the CI/CD pipeline: Service evolution
Now that you successfully deployed both apps to PWS, try to exercise both service evolution scenarios:
1) [Change PersonService endpoint from /person to /people](#service-evolution-change-personservice-endpoint-from-person-to-people)
1) [Change Person schema attribute from surname to lastname](#service-evolution-change-person-schema-attribute-from-surname-to-lastname)

__IMPORTANT: Please remember to `git push` your changes to the repo. The Concourse pipeline polls the Github repo for changes every minute.__

Can you describe what happens?
